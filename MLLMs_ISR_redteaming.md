## **Advanced Functional Paradigms and Strategic Implementations of Multi-modal Large Language Models and Vision-Language Architectures in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance**

The domain of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) is currently undergoing a foundational shift, transitioning from traditional discriminative computer vision paradigms toward generative, multi-modal frameworks. Historically, ISR systems relied on specialized models designed for narrow tasks such as object detection, image classification, or signal processing. These legacy systems, while effective in controlled environments, often lacked the flexibility to adapt to novel threats or the ability to synthesize information across disparate data streams like text, imagery, and electronic signals. The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) addresses these limitations by providing a unified architecture capable of cross-modal reasoning, natural language interaction, and complex situational assessment. This evolution represents a move from passive perception to proactive, "agentic" intelligence, where systems do not merely identify objects but reason about their intent, context, and future trajectories.

## **Architectural Mechanics and the Integration of Visual Cognition**

The fundamental innovation of a Vision-Language Model lies in its ability to integrate the semantic depth of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the perceptual capabilities of advanced vision encoders. Unlike traditional vision systems that output simple labels or bounding boxes, VLMs process visual information as part of a continuous linguistic context, effectively allowing the model to "see" and "describe" the world in human-readable terms.

### **The Tripartite Framework of Vision-Language Models**

Most modern VLMs follow a modular architecture consisting of three primary components: a vision encoder, a connector or projector, and a language model backbone. The vision encoder, typically a transformer-based model like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), is pre-trained on vast datasets of image-text pairs. This allows the encoder to extract high-level semantic features from visual inputs—whether they are static images or frames from a video feed—and represent them in a latent space that shares commonalities with language.

The projector serves as the bridge between modalities. It can range from a simple linear layer, as seen in early versions of LLaVA (Large Language-and-Vision Assistant), to more sophisticated cross-attention mechanisms used in models like Llama 3.2 Vision. This component translates visual features into "visual tokens" that the LLM can process alongside textual tokens. Finally, the LLM backbone acts as the reasoning engine, utilizing its pre-trained knowledge to generate responses that synthesize both the visual evidence and the user’s natural language instructions.

| Component | Technical Implementation | Functional Role in ISR |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Vision Encoder | CLIP-based, ViT (Vision Transformer). | Feature extraction and semantic grounding of visual evidence. |
| Projector/Connector | Linear layers, MLP, or Cross-attention. | Modality alignment; translating pixels into linguistic tokens. |
| LLM Backbone | Llama, GPT, Qwen, or proprietary decoders. | High-level reasoning, report generation, and strategic inference. |
| Output Head | Autoregressive decoder or diffusion policy. | Natural language answers or autonomous motor commands. |

The generative nature of these models is a radical departure from discriminative AI. Instead of being bound to a fixed set of classes, a VLM can be instructed in natural language to perform zero-shot tasks—identifying a specific type of camouflage or describing the activity level at a remote outpost—without requiring task-specific retraining. This flexibility is critical in ISR, where the operational environment and target priorities can shift rapidly.

## **Functional Use Cases in Intelligence Collection and Processing**

In the intelligence cycle, the phase of processing and exploitation is often the most significant bottleneck due to the "data deluge" generated by ubiquitous sensors. VLMs are being deployed to automate the filtration and analysis of this data, transforming raw feeds into actionable intelligence with minimal human intervention.

### **Visual Question Answering (VQA) in Tactical Reconnaissance**

Visual Question Answering (VQA) has emerged as one of the most common and powerful use cases for VLMs in ISR. VQA allows an operator to interact with visual data repositories using natural language queries. This capability is particularly valuable for "needle-in-a-stack" searches across hours of drone surveillance footage or thousands of satellite images.

The functions of VQA in ISR include object recognition (e.g., "What type of artillery is present in this frame?"), attribute identification (e.g., "Are the vehicles marked with a specific insignia?"), and scene understanding (e.g., "Does this gathering appear to be military or civilian in nature?"). Beyond simple identification, advanced MLLMs are being evaluated for their ability to handle open-ended reasoning tasks. For instance, a model might be asked, "Based on the arrangement of these supply trucks, what is the estimated readiness level of this unit?". While current models still exhibit limitations in complex reasoning compared to specialized solvers, their ability to provide a "preliminary assessment" significantly reduces the cognitive load on human analysts.

### **Automated ISR Exploitation Reporting**

A highly formalized function of ISR is the generation of mission result messages. These reports must adhere to strict international and military standards to ensure interoperability across coalition forces. Software systems like i2exrep (Interactive ISR Exploitation Report) leverage AI to streamline this process. VLMs can automatically extract relevant data from sensors—including the type, status, and position of identified objects—and format this information into standardized report types.

| Report Type | Sensor/Task Context | Military Standard Compliance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| RECCEXREP | Electro-optical evaluation/reconnaissance. | STANAG 4559 / AEDP-17. |
| IPIR | Initial Phase Interpretation Report. | NATO Standardized Reporting. |
| RADAREXREP | Radar-based evaluation and targeting. | Electronic Intelligence standards. |
| MIEXREP | Video exploitation and activity monitoring. | Moving target reconnaissance. |
| ISRSPOTREP | Urgent tactical intelligence updates. | C4ISR interoperability. |

The integration of VLMs into these reporting workflows ensures that the vocabulary used is consistent with doctrinal categories, such as those defined in STANAG 3596\. This automation not only speeds up the dissemination of intelligence but also facilitates automatic further processing by higher-level Command and Control (C2) information systems.

## **Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and Multi-Sensor Fusion**

GEOINT applications require the synthesis of data from multiple sources, each with its own physical imaging principles. One of the most critical challenges in remote sensing is the effective fusion of Optical (RGB) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.

### **The EarthMind Framework and Cross-Modal Fusion**

The EarthMind framework represents a state-of-the-art implementation of MLLMs for Earth Observation (EO). It is specifically designed to handle the complementary nature of optical and SAR sensors. Optical sensors provide rich textural and spectral information but are limited by solar illumination and weather conditions. SAR, an active sensor, can penetrate clouds, smoke, and darkness, providing structural details and all-weather monitoring, though the resulting imagery is often difficult for humans to interpret due to "speckle noise" and geometric distortions.

EarthMind utilizes two core mechanisms to achieve superior GEOINT performance:

1. **Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP):** This technique reallocates attention within the LLM to enhance pixel-level understanding, which is essential for tasks like fine-grained segmentation and target identification.  
2. **Hierarchical Cross-modal Attention (HCA):** This mechanism adaptively fuses optical and SAR features based on their information density. In conditions where optical data is degraded by cloud cover, the model automatically increases the weight of SAR-derived structural information to maintain situational awareness.

The implications for change detection are profound. Traditional change detection often relies on single-modal analysis, which can be prone to "pseudo-changes" caused by variations in lighting or shadows. Multi-modal agents like MMUEChange integrate heterogeneous urban data through a "Modality Controller," enabling robust analysis of complex change scenarios, such as infrastructure damage assessment after a conflict or natural disaster.

### **Envisioned Use: Generative SAR-to-Optical Translation**

An emerging use case for multi-modal models is the translation of non-visual sensor data into visually intuitive formats. Researchers are exploring the use of Diffusion Models to generate synthetic RGB images from raw SAR data. This "SAR-to-RGB" translation effectively "reconstructs" what an area would look like to the human eye, even when obscured by thick smoke or heavy cloud cover. By training these models on paired S1 (SAR) and S2 (Optical) data, the system learns to hallucinate realistic spectral reflectance based on the structural signatures captured by the radar. This capability is envisioned as a critical tool for human-in-the-loop analysis, allowing commanders to view a "generated" optical picture of a battlefield in real-time regardless of environmental conditions.

## **Integration of Diverse Intelligence Disciplines: SIGINT and OSINT**

While vision-language models are predominantly associated with imagery, their underlying transformer architectures are increasingly being used to bridge the gap between GEOINT and other intelligence disciplines, such as Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).

### **LLMs in the Linguistic Intelligence Cycle**

Large Language Models are being utilized to automate the analysis of vast amounts of textual data from social networks (SOCMINT) and public media. In the context of counter-terrorism and domestic security, LLMs can identify patterns of communication indicative of radicalization or the planning of kinetic events. These systems can generate structured reports that justify their classification by providing evidence based on identified communication patterns, significantly accelerating the preliminary assessment of potentially critical profiles.

Furthermore, LLMs act as a "linguistic bridge" between technical intelligence specialists and decision-makers. They are used to translate technical jargon from fields like Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) or Radar Intelligence (RADINT) into natural language summaries that can be incorporated into situational reports. This "late fusion" of multi-modal streams—where an LLM integrates a textual SIGINT summary with a visual GEOINT report—enables a more holistic understanding of the operational environment.

## **Autonomous Systems and Embodied ISR Agents**

The transition from passive reconnaissance to active autonomy is facilitated by Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. These models represent the "next generation" of ISR, where the AI system is not just an observer but an agent capable of making decisions and executing motor commands.

### **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Paradigms in Robotics**

A VLA model takes multimodal inputs (text instructions, images, and video) and outputs either high-level goals or low-level motor actions. The "edge" of these models lies in their closed-loop grounding: they act, observe the result, and adjust their next decision in real-time. This loop is essential for autonomous UAVs or Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) navigating through dynamic and cluttered environments.

| Capability | VLA Implementation | ISR Mission Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Closed-loop Grounding | Continuous sensory feedback into the policy transformer. | Real-time adjustment to environmental changes or evasive maneuvers. |
| Instruction Following | Translating abstract language (e.g., "search behind the building") into vectors. | Natural language control of robotic swarms by field personnel. |
| Cross-Platform Generalization | Zero-shot deployment across different robot embodiments. | Rapid deployment of intelligence capabilities across heterogeneous fleets. |
| Semantic Navigation | Path planning guided by object-level reasoning. | Avoiding threats based on visual identification, not just obstacle avoidance. |

For example, a drone equipped with a VLA model could be instructed to "follow the white vehicle and alert if it enters a restricted zone". The model doesn't just track a set of pixels; it understands the concept of "vehicle," "follow," and "restricted zone," and can autonomously navigate to maintain visual contact while respecting spatial constraints.

### **UAV Autonomy and Mission Planning**

In the domain of aerial reconnaissance, MLLMs are being integrated into UAV systems to improve autonomy and interpretable decision-making. Traditionally, UAV mission planning relied on complex optimization frameworks that struggled with training complexity. LLMs, however, can augment these systems by providing "context-aware" control, using knowledge graphs to interpret mission parameters and dynamic environmental data.

Envisioned uses of LLM-driven UAVs include:

* **Role-Adaptive Swarms:** Multiple drones communicating via semantic language to dynamically switch roles (e.g., one drone acts as a relay while others conduct low-altitude search).  
* **Intelligent Data Collection:** Scheduling sensor activation based on the "age of information" and the perceived importance of specific targets, thereby optimizing battery life and bandwidth.  
* **3D Aerial Highways:** Hierarchical architectures where high-altitude platforms provide strategic guidance to tactical UAVs for maneuvering through complex urban landscapes.

## **Adversarial Red Teaming and Security Robustness**

The rapid advancement of MLLMs in mission-critical ISR introduces profound security vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional software, MLLMs can be "jailbroken"—induced to bypass safety alignment and generate harmful, unauthorized, or policy-violating outputs through sophisticated multimodal prompts. Recent research has identified several emerging adversarial approaches that specifically target the cross-modal nature of these systems.

### **Taxonomy of Emerging Adversarial Attacks**

Adversarial strategies for red teaming MLLMs generally fall into two categories: **white-box** (gradient-based) and **black-box** (structured inputs).

* **FigStep (and FigStep-Pro):** A black-box algorithm that bypasses safety filters by embedding prohibited textual content into images via typography. It exploits the fact that visual embeddings are often semantically but not "safely" aligned with the model's text-based safeguards. FigStep-Pro extends this by using visual keyword decomposition to further obfuscate intent.  
* **HADES (Hiding and Amplifying harmfulness):** A three-stage attack that extracts harmful intent into typographic images and then amplifies that harmfulness through iterative prompt optimization and gradient updates.  
* **HIMRD (Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution):** This method segments a single harmful instruction across multiple modalities (e.g., part in text, part in image) such that no single modality appears malicious to independent filters.  
* **MML (Multi-Modal Linkage):** Drawing on cryptography, MML uses an encryption-decryption scheme where harmful information is "encrypted" (e.g., word substitution) in the image and "decrypted" by the model through stealthy text guidance.  
* **CS-DJ (Contrasting Subimage Distraction):** Disrupts alignment by decomposing harmful queries and constructing contrasting subimages to distract the model's internal attention mechanisms.  
* **JOOD (Jailbreak via OOD-ifying):** Transforms vanilla harmful inputs into out-of-distribution (OOD) versions, increasing the model's uncertainty and causing its safety guardrails to fail.  
* **SI-Attack (Shuffle Inconsistency):** Exploits the gap between an MLLM’s comprehension and safety abilities by shuffling harmful instructions. Models can understand the shuffled command but fail to trigger their safety refusal mechanism.  
* **IDEATOR:** An automated red-teaming framework that uses a VLM as an agent to iteratively design and refine multimodal adversarial prompts.  
* **Query-Relevant (QR-Attack):** Demonstrates that MLLMs are more likely to respond to malicious queries if paired with an image relevant to the query's context, even without pixel-level perturbations.

Based on current research and benchmark toolboxes like OmniSafeBench-MM (https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/OmniSafeBench-MM), the attacks discussed in the taxonomy are categorized primarily by the level of access an adversary has to the target model’s internal parameters and gradients.

**Black-Box Attacks**
These attacks do not require access to the model’s internal architecture or weights. They rely on interacting with the model's input-output interface or using "structured visual carriers" like typography to bypass safety filters. All the specific emerging techniques listed in the taxonomy section of the report are classified as black-box:
- FigStep (and FigStep-Pro): Operates by embedding prohibited text into images through typography.
- Query-Relevant (QR-Attack): Pairs a malicious text query with a relevant image created by a diffusion model to lower the model’s refusal threshold.
- HADES: Although it can involve iterative optimization, it is categorized as a black-box attack because it functions through structured visual carriers that amplify harmful intent without needing direct model access.
- HIMRD: A black-box strategy that heuristically segments harmful instructions across multiple modalities to avoid detection by independent modality filters.
- MML (Multi-Modal Linkage): Uses a cross-modal encryption-decryption pipeline that treats the target model as a black box.
- CS-DJ: Uses visually complex compositions and query decomposition to distract the model's alignment mechanisms.
- JOOD: A jailbreak strategy that transforms inputs into out-of-distribution (OOD) versions to increase model uncertainty.
- SI-Attack: A black-box attack that exploits comprehension inconsistencies by shuffling harmful instructions.
- IDEATOR: An automated framework that uses a second VLM as a red-team agent to autonomously design and refine adversarial prompts in a black-box setting.

**White-Box Attacks**
In contrast, white-box attacks require complete knowledge of the target model's architecture and parameters, using gradient-based optimization to generate precise adversarial perturbations at the pixel or token level. These are typically used to test open-source models like LLaVA or MiniGPT-4 where model weights are public. Representative white-box methods include:
- Visual-Adv: Extends adversarial optimization on the visual channel to disrupt multi-modal alignment.
- ImgJP & DeltaJP: Gradient-based methods focused on finding the most effective visual perturbations to bypass safety guardrails.
- UMK (Universal Multimodal Key): A dual-modality attack that simultaneously optimizes perturbations for both vision and text inputs.
- JPS: Achieves jailbreaks by collaboratively optimizing visual perturbations and textual steering prompts through backpropagation.

### **Robustness Evaluation Plans for ISR Use Cases**

To ensure the security of ISR workflows, the system must be tested against these specific vectors.

#### **1\. Tactical Reconnaissance (VQA)**

* **Vulnerability:** Adversaries may use typography to trick an analyst's VQA tool into misidentifying civilian buildings as military targets or vice versa.  
* **Testing Plan:** Apply **FigStep** and **HADES** to generate images where standardized military symbols or "High Value Target" text are embedded typographically. Evaluate the model's **Attack Success Rate (ASR)** in classifying these targets compared to base-aligned models.

#### **2\. Automated ISR Reporting**

* **Vulnerability:** An adversary could inject false data into a standardized STANAG 4559 report by bypassing the model's "truthfulness" filters.  
* **Testing Plan:** Use **MML** to "encrypt" false coordinate data or target types within a visual feed. Test whether the model, when prompted with seemingly benign text, "decrypts" the false visual information into the final **IPIR** or **ISRSPOTREP** report.

#### **3\. GEOINT and Multi-Sensor Fusion**

* **Vulnerability:** Adversaries might distract the model's attention away from a genuine change (e.g., a new missile battery) by using high-contrast "decoys" in one sensor stream.  
* **Testing Plan:** Implement **CS-DJ** and **JOOD** by providing contrasting subimages (SAR vs. Optical) where the SAR data contains a threat but the Optical data contains a distracting, benign, high-salience object. Measure if the **Modality Controller** correctly prioritizes the threat or is distracted.1

#### **4\. Autonomous Embodied Agents (VLA)**

* **Vulnerability:** A drone could be induced to perform a forbidden action (e.g., entering a no-fly zone) if the command is obfuscated through shuffle inconsistency.  
* **Testing Plan:** Deploy **SI-Attack** by providing the drone with shuffled instructions such as "Zone prohibited... Fly into... Ignore constraints". Evaluate the **Instance Success Rate (ISR)**—in this context, the rate at which the drone executes the harmful motor command.2

#### **5\. SIGINT and OSINT Integration**

* **Vulnerability:** Strategic decision-making models can be misled by "evil alignment" scenarios generated by external adversarial VLMs.  
* **Testing Plan:** Utilize **IDEATOR** to autonomously generate "decoy" narratives in OSINT streams that align with a model's existing biases. Use **Query-Relevant** images to see if the model adopts the adversary's narrative in its final situational assessment.

## **Conclusion**

The integration of multi-modal large language models and vision-language architectures is fundamentally redefining ISR capabilities. However, as these systems move from passive perception to agentic reasoning, they become targets for sophisticated adversarial tactics like FigStep, HIMRD, and SI-Attack. Securing the future of ISR requires moving beyond static safety patches toward a "multi-layered security approach" that combines adversarial training (e.g., ProEAT), robust architectures, and real-time monitoring of multimodal embeddings. As models advance toward predictive world-modeling, the "intelligence" in ISR must encompass not only the ability to see the world but also the resilience to withstand deliberate manipulation of its perception.
